# Algorithms and Data structures 📚
This repository contains my steps in learning CS. To understand the basics, I code algorithms and data structures from scratch.

**Data structures**
- [ ] Array
- [ ] Linked list
- [ ] B-Tree

| Searching algorithms                        |     ⏱    |  💾  |
|:-------------------------------------------:|:---------:|:----:|
| [Binary search](searching/binary_search.py) | O(log(n)) | O(1) |

| Sorting algorithms                          |     ⏱    |  💾  |
|:-------------------------------------------:|:---------:|:----:|
| Insertion sort |  |  |
| Selection sort |  |  |
| Bubble sort |  | |
| Counting sort |   |   |
| Quicksort |   |   |
| Mergesort |   |   |

Each algorithms has its runtime (⏱) and space (💾) complexity, here are the typical ones
