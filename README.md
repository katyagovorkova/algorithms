# Algorithms and Data structures ðŸ“š
This repository contains my steps in learning CS. 
To understand the basics, I algorithms and data structures from scratch.

Here is the list of what I plan to do:

Data structures
- [x] Array
- [x] Linked list
- [x] B-Tree

Algorithms
- [x] Binary search
- [x] Bubble sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Quicksort

Each algorithms has its runtime complexity, here are the typical ones
