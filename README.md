# Algorithms and Data structures ðŸ“š
This repository contains my steps in learning CS. 
To understand the basics, I algorithms and data structures from scratch.

Here is the list of what I plan to do:

Data structures
- [ ] Array
- [ ] Linked list
- [ ] B-Tree

Algorithms
- [x] Binary search
- [ ] Bubble sort
- [ ] Insertion sort
- [ ] Quicksort

Each algorithms has its runtime complexity, here are the typical ones
