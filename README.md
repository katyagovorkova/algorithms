# Algorithms and Data structures ðŸ“š
This repository contains my steps in learning CS.

To understand the basics, I code algorithms and data structures from scratch.
Here is the list of what I plan to do:

**Data structures**
- [ ] Array
- [ ] Linked list
- [ ] B-Tree

**Algorithms**
- [x] [Binary search](simple_algorithms/binary_search.py) t~O(log(n))
- [ ] Bubble sort
- [ ] Insertion sort
- [ ] Quicksort

Each algorithms has its runtime complexity, here are the typical ones
